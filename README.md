# Link to note

![](demo_gif.gif)

This plugin adds an icon to the toolbar. When clicked, it creates a link to the note with a title matching the selected text (or, if such a note does not exist, creates it).

Also adds a link back to the current note.

This plugin is experimental and comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind. Use at your own risk.

The main two files you will want to look at are:
